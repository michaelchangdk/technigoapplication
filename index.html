    <h1>11. Framework</h1>
    <h3>What is a <em>framework?</em></h3>
    <p>A framework is simply a reusable library of JavaScript tools that allow us to create complex, interactive websites often known as web applications. Frameworks are libraries of JavaScript that have opinions about how web applications are
      built, and allow for predictable and homogenous web applications that can be scaled reliably. Frameworks don't bring new power to JavaScript, instead they provide a <em>better developer experience</em> by giving developers easier access to
      JavaScript's powers.
      <br>
      <br>
      Framework and library are often used interchangeably, but the key difference is "inversion of control". Frameworks are "opinionated", while libraries are "un-opinionated", and these terms subjectively try to define the level of freedom a
      developer has when structuring their code.
